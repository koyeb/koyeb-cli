## v5.2.0 (unreleased)
* Add the `snapshots` subcommand to manage volume snapshots.
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/pull/250/files
* Add the `--snapshot` flag to the volume creation command, to create a volume from a snapshot.
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/pull/254/files
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/pull/255/files

## v5.1.0 (2024-09-26)

* Add `--deployment-strategy` which can have the value `rolling`, `blue-green` or `immediate` to service. 
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/pull/248/files
* Fix the logic on how validation is performed for `--port` to avoid raising an error when `TCP` ports are used and `--routes` are not set.

## v5.0.0 (2024-08-20)

* Breaking change: the application name needs to be provided with `koyeb db` commands. In the past, the command `koyeb db create mydb` created a database named `mydb` under the hardcoded application `koyeb-db-preview-app`. With this new version, it is mandatory to specify the service name, for example with `koyeb db create myapp/mydb` or `koyeb db create mydb --app myapp`.
* Allow to rename a database with `koyeb db update myapp/mydb --name newname`.

## v4.3.0 (2024-07-31)

* Change the `volumes` subcommand to handle sizes in GB.
* Add `--checks-grace-period` to set the grace period for health checks, for example with `koyeb service update app/service --checks 8000:http:/healtcheck --checks-grace-period 8000=10`.
* Add `--since` to `koyeb service logs`, `koyeb deployment logs` and `koyeb instance logs`.
* Reconnect logs when the websocket is closed.

## v4.2.0

* Add `volumes` subcommand.
* Allow to edit service volumes with `koyeb service update --volume`.
* Better error message when performing actions requiring a user context with an organization token.
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/pull/235

## v4.1.1 (2024-06-06)

* Fix release.

## v4.1.0 (2024-06-06)

* Add `--autoscaling-concurrent-requests` and `--autoscaling-requests-response-time` to `koyeb service create` and `koyeb service update`.

## v4.0.0 (2024-05-22)

* Fix nil dereference in `koyeb deployment logs -t build`.
* Create new command `koyeb archives create <path>` to store an archive. This command will be necessary for the future deployment of a directory.
* Add `--archive` parameters to `koyeb service create` and `koyeb service update` to deploy an archive instead of a Docker image. The archive is stored in GCS and can be created with `koyeb archives create`.
* Add command `koyeb deploy <directory> <app_name>/<service_name>`.
* Allow to specify `--git-sha` in `koyeb service update` and `koyeb service create`. Warning: if the service is deployed with a specific git sha (which is the case if the deployment has been triggered by the "git push" webhook), `koyeb service update` without `--git-sha` will no longer deploy the latest commit, but the commit set in the configuration. To deploy the latest commit, use `koyeb service update --git-sha ''`.

* Add instance ID to `koyeb service logs`, `koyeb deployment logs` and `koyeb instance logs`
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/pull/202
* Add the `--save-only` flag to the `koyeb services update` command, that only saves the changes and does not trigger an immediate deploy.
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/pull/200
* Support `-o json` for `koyeb service logs`, `koyeb deployment logs` and `koyeb instance logs`
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/issues/203
* Add command `koyeb metrics get` to get the metrics of a service or an instance
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/issues/162
* It is now possible to create services only available from the mesh, for example with `koyeb service create app/service --docker nginx --port 80:tcp`. With only `--port 80` (equivalent to `--port 80:http`), the service is also exposed to the internet.
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/issues/207

## v3.10.0 (2024-03-28)

## v3.6.0

Similarly, `koyeb service create xxx --app yyy --route /:9999` automatically creates the port `9999:http`. If `--port` and `--route` are both omitted, as before, the default port `80:http` and route `/:80` are created.
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/issues/101

## v3.3.1

* Fix a bug where `koyeb services exec` / `koyeb instances exec` would not work for users being members of multiple organizations
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/pull/146

## v3.3.0

* Add the flag `--privileged` to `koyeb service create` and `koyeb service update`
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/issues/137

## v3.2.0

Also, add the option `--scale` which sets both `--min-scale` and `--max-scale` to the same value. If `--min-scale` or `--max-scale` is set, it overrides `--scale`.
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/issues/122
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/pull/124
* Add completion for fish shell, thanks to @razvanazamfirei

* Fix `koyeb service logs` when using the non-default organization
  - https://github.com/koyeb/koyeb-cli/issues/120
* Fix `--regions` options of `koyeb service create` and `koyeb service update`. To deploy an existing service to a new region, use `koyeb service update <app>/<service> --region <region>`. To remove a region from a service, use `koyeb service update <app>/<service> --region '!<region>'`. On service creation, the service is still deployed to `fra` if no region is specified. If more than two regions are specified, a warning message is displayed to avoid billing surprises.
